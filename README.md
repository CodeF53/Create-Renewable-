# Create Renewable Ores

A Minecraft Datapack for [Create Farbic](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create) that adds renewable recipes for crimsite, ochrum, veridium, and asurine.

These can be crushed to iron/gold/zinc/copper, thus renewable ores.

This is forked from [CreatePlus](https://github.com/JieningYu/CreatePlus-mod/), only keeping these 4 recipes.
